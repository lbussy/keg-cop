# Printed Circuit Boards for Keg Cop

Contained here are two folders:

- **Main Boards:** Boards which receive the D32 controller, and provide connectivity to the breakouts.
- **Breakouts:** Boards which distribute and receive signals within the kegerator/keezer.

The type and number required of each board will vary by the intended configuration.  Use this flowchart to determine which boards you need and how many:
