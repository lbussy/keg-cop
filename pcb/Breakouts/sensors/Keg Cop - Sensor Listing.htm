<h3>Buying Here</h3>
<div><p>When you purchase this board here, you are paying a small premium (10%) which goes into my account. That credit is used in the development of these and other projects. Anyone who has done development like this can tell you how many boards we go through, and the cost is not insignificant. You may absolutely take the files from GitHub and upload them yourself to avoid that small markup if you choose. If you do purchase them here, it's only fair I tell you about it, and what I will do with the credits.</p></div>
