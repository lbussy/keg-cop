# TODO:

## Testing

- Test all settings flow/application

## Features

- Add target pushes
    - Target URL (mega report)
    - Cloud (or disable)
- Add Keg Screen semaphores for reports
    - bool sendTapInfo(int);              // Push complete tap info (single tap)
    - ~~bool sendPourReport(int, float);    // Send pour report when a pour is done (single tap)~~
    - ~~bool sendKickReport(int);           // Send a kick report when keg kicks~~
    - ~~bool sendCoolState();               // Send temp status when a cooling state changes~~
    - bool sendTempReport();              // Send a temp report on timer
- Document API
- Document Keg Cop page
- Maybe add a "ping" after page failure to recover
- Look at "other pages" with JS to split them out?
