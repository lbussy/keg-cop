This page allows you to set temperature contol options.

- **Set Point in (°F or °C)**:
  \- **Temperature**: Allows setting the desired system temperature setpoint.
  \- **Enabled/Disabled**: Turns temperature control on or off.
- **Control Point**: Select the teperature sensor by which the system will control.
- **Invert Cooling Control**: The system defaults to "Normal" which means the cooling pin will go low when there is demand for cooling.  Ths is the proper setting for typical relay boards, but the end user may desire to invert this and cool on high for a number of reasons.
