If you plan to move your Keg Cop to a new location or connect to a new network, resetting the network settings ahead of time is a good idea.  Pressing the "Reset WiFi" button is an irreversible action and will delete the current WiFi configuration.

After this action, you will need to reconnect to the *kegcop* access point to reconfigure the WiFi settings.
