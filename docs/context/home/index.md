The Keg Cop home page is displayed when you first connect via your chosen web browser.  You will see a main menu across the top border if you connect with a standard desktop web browser.  If in a mobile or portrait mode browser window, the list displays when you click the hamburger bar ({{ equiv }}) in the top-right corner.

In the top-left side of the main container is a title concatenated from the {ref}`kegerator <controller>` and {ref}`brewery name <controller>` (e.g. "Main Kegerator in Silver Fox Brewery.")

On the right side of this container is the current control point temperature if used.  The block around the temperature indicates the temperature control status. You may also hover over this section for a tooltip explaining the state.

Within the page, you will see a list of the active taps on your system.  The bars will show the relative amount of beverage remaining for each tap.  The bars themselves have a mouseover effect that will display a tooltip containing detailed information.
