Keg Cop API
################

Keg Cop uses a combination of API types:

- `Action Pages`_
- `JSON Retrieval`_
- `Settings Handlers (POST)`_
- `POSTed JSON Report`_
- `Serial Reports`_
- `Keg Screen Reports`_

Action Pages
*************

These action pages cause an action to be performed via the GET action.

- ``/clearupdate/``: Clears all of the OTA update semaphores, used for update cadence as the controller reboots
- ``/clearcalmode/``: Clears all of the tap calibration flags
- ``/heap/``: Returns result from ESP.getFreeHeap() call
- ``/oktowifireset/``: Performs `AsynchWiFiManagerReset::resetSettings();` to immediately delete all stored WiFi access point information, and reboots controller
- ``/otastart/``: Begins Firmware OTA
- ``/ping/``  Sends 200, Ok.  Used as a simple ping test

JSON Retrieval
****************

These pages return proper JSON reports for configuration and status items:

- `/config/`_
- `/thatVersion/`_
- `/thisVersion/`_
- `/flow/`_
- `/pulses/`_
- `/sensors/`_

/config/
===========

``/config/`` returns most of the application configuration from memory. This information is also available from the SPIFFS file ``config.json``.  The format is as follows:

.. code-block:: json
    :linenos:

    {
    "apconfig": {
        "ssid": "kegcop",
        "passphrase": "kegcop12"
    },
    "hostname": "kegcop",
    "copconfig": {

        "keg": 1
    },
    "urltarget": {
        "url": "",
        "freq": 30,
        "update": false
    },
    "cloud": {
        "type": 0,
        "url": "",
        "key": "",
        "freq": 15,
        "update": false
    },
    "dospiffs1": false,
    "dospiffs2": false,
    "didupdate": false
    }

/thatVersion/
===============

``/thatVersion/`` reports the firmware version available on the project website.  The format is as follows:

.. code-block:: json
    :linenos:

    {
        "version": "0.0.2"
    }

/thisVersion/
==============

``/thisVersion/`` reports the current installed firmware version determined by a compile-time macro.  The format is as follows:

.. code-block:: json
    :linenos:

    {
        "version": "0.0.1"
    }

/flow/
=========

``/flow/`` returns whether the controller is set for imperial units (``true``) or metric (``false``).  It also contains the status for each tap:

- ``tapid``: The tap ID numbered 0-7
- ``pin``: Controller pin connected to the flowmeter
- ``ppu``: Pulses per unit in Pulses per Gallon when configured as imperial, and Pulses per Liter when configured as metric
- ``name``: Name of the beverage, displayed on the home page
- ``capacity``: This is the capacity of the keg in gallons or liters, depending on the units of measure set for the system
- ``remaining``: This is the calculated liquid remaining in the keg in gallons or liters depending on the units of measure set for the system
- ``active``: Whether the tap is active or not. This determines whether the tap will display on the home page or not
- ``calibrating``: A flag used to put the tap in calibration mode. When set, the tap will not debit until set to false.

This information is also available as the SPIFFS file ``flow.json``. The format is as follows:

        }
        ]
    }

/pulses/
===========

``/pulses/`` returns the accumulated pulses for each tap. These numbers will only increment significantly when the tap is in calibration mode. The format is as follows:

.. code-block:: json
    :linenos:

    {
        "pulses": [
            0,

            0,
            0
        ]
    }

/sensors/
===========

``/sensors/`` returns information derived from other sources in memory related to the temperature sensors in the system and the current readings.  Information includes:

- ``imperial``: This is identical to the setting contained in ``config`` and indicates whether the system is set for imperial or metric
- ``controlpoint``: The index of the sensor used to provide temperature control
- ``setting``: The temperature control setting in °F or °C depending on whether the system is set for imperial or not
- ``status``: One of eight thermostat states as defined below
- ``controlenabled``: 
- ``sensors``: 
- ``displayenabled``: 

Thermostat State:

- ``0``: ``TSTAT_INACTIVE`` - Thermostat is disabled
- ``1``: ``TSTAT_COOL_BEGIN`` - Thermostat is starting to cool
- ``2``: ``TSTAT_COOL_MINOFF`` - Thermostat is calling for cooling but in minimum off time
- ``3``: ``TSTAT_COOL_ACTIVE`` - Thermostat is actively cooling
- ``4``: ``TSTAT_OFF_END`` - Thermostat is not calling for cooling, minimum off time ending
- ``5``: ``TSTAT_OFF_MINON`` - Thermostat is not calling for cooling but in minimum on time
- ``6``: ``TSTAT_OFF_INACTIVE`` - Thermostat is not calling for cooling, in idle mode
- ``7``: ``TSTAT_UNKNOWN`` - Thermostat is in an unknown state

Additionally, for each sensor, the following is displayed:

- ``enable``: Wether the temperature sensor point is enabled
- ``name``: The temperature sensor name
- ``value``: The current one minute averaged temperature, with any calibration applied

The format is as follows:

.. code-block:: json
    :linenos:

    {
        "imperial": true,
        "controlpoint": 4,
        "setting": 35,

                "value": 74.3
            },
            {
                "enable": true,
                "name": "Keg",
                "value": 79.7
            }
        ],
        "displayenabled": true
    }
