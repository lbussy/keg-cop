Keg Cop API
################

Keg Cop uses a combination of API types:

- `Action Pages`_
- `JSON Retrieval`_
- `Settings Handlers (POST)`_
- `Target URL Report`_
- `RaspberryPints Reports`_
- `Keg Screen Reports`_

Action Pages
*************

These action pages operate via the GET action.

- ``/clearupdate/``: Clears all of the OTA update semaphores, used for update cadence as the controller reboots
- ``/clearcalmode/``: Clears all of the tap calibration flags
- ``/heap/``: Returns result from ESP.getFreeHeap() call
- ``/oktowifireset/``: Performs `AsynchWiFiManagerReset::resetSettings();` to immediately delete all stored WiFi access point information, and reboots controller
- ``/otastart/``: Begins Firmware OTA
- ``/ping/``  Sends 200, Ok.  Used as a simple ping test

JSON Retrieval
****************

These pages return proper JSON reports for configuration and status items:

- `/config/`_
- `/thatVersion/`_
- `/thisVersion/`_
- `/flow/`_
- `/pulses/`_
- `/sensors/`_

/config/
===========

``/config/`` returns most of the application configuration from memory. This information is also available from the SPIFFS file ``config.json``.  The format is as follows:

.. code-block:: json
    :linenos:

        "didupdate": false
    }

/thatVersion/
===============

``/thatVersion/`` reports the firmware version available on the project website.  The format is as follows:

.. code-block:: json
    :linenos:

    {
        "version": "0.0.2"
    }

==============

``/thisVersion/`` reports the current installed firmware version determined by a compile-time macro.  The format is as follows:

.. code-block:: json
    :linenos:

    {
        "version": "0.0.1"
    }

/flow/
=========

``/flow/`` returns the setting for imperial units as (``true``) or metric (``false``).  It also contains the status for each tap:

- ``tapid``: The tap ID numbered 0-7

            0
        ]
    }

/sensors/
===========

``/sensors/`` returns information derived from other sources in memory related to the system's temperature sensors and the current readings.  Information includes:

- `/settings/update/`_

/setcalmode/
==============

POSTing the appropriate entry to this endpoint will cause the specified tap to enter calibration mode and accumulate pulses.  The ``http://kegcop.local/settings/#flowcal`` page provides this information.  The POST syntax is:

- ``tapnum:{n}``, where ``{n}`` is the tap number, 0-7, of the tap to place in configuration mode.

/settings/controller/
=======================

Entries POSTed to this endpoint will configure many elements of the controller's behavior.  The ``http://kegcop.local/settings/#controller`` page provides this information.  The POST syntax is:

- ``enablekeg:{bool}``, where ``{bool}`` is true or false to enable or disable the use of the Keg Temperature Sensor

/settings/tapcontrol/
========================

Entries POSTed to this endpoint will configure the taps configured for the controller.  These items are sent from the ``http://kegcop.local/settings/#tap{n}`` page where ``{n}`` is the selected tap.  The POST syntax is:

- ``tap:{n}``, where ``{n}`` is the index of the tap, 0-7, setting the following;
- ``ppu:{n}``, where ``{n}`` is pulses per unit of flowmeter pulses in gallons or liters depending on the imperial or metric configuration
- ``beername:{beverage name}``, where ``{beverage name}`` is the name of the beverage on the selected tap
- ``cap:{n.n}``, where ``{n.n}`` is a floating-point number for the keg's capacity in gallons or liters, depending on the imperial or metric configuration
- ``remain:{n.n}``, where ``{n.n}`` is a floating-point number for the liquid remaining in the keg in gallons or liters

/settings/update/
====================

Entries POSTed to this endpoint will pass through the control routines for all other control points.  This endpoint serves as a single point for mass configuration.  There is no web page executing this POST within the system.

Target URL Report
*******************

The Target URL Report provides a holistic picture of the system to a custom/third-party endpoint. It is a timer-based POST; a change of state does not trigger it. As with all target system configuration within Keg Cop, it will post to HTTP only. The format is as follows:

.. code-block:: json

When configured as a RaspberryPints-compatible controller, Keg Screen disables all serial debug printing and provides reports via the serial connection.  There are two RaspberryPints-compatible reports:

- Pour Report
- Kick Report

Pour Report
============

Keg Cop will issue the Pour Report after a pour when the controller detects that the pour has stopped.  The report follows this format:

``P;1;4;3200``

A semicolon (``;``) delimits the fields, and the fields are as follows:

- ``P`` - Report Type: The "P" in the first field designates this as a "Pour Report."
- ``1`` - Address: The "1" here is the tap number for the pour.
- ``4`` - Pin Number: The "4" here is the controller pin number for the pour.
- ``3200`` - Pulse Count: This is the number of pulses detected during the pour.

For RandR+-compatible systems, the Pour Report is slightly different.  For example:

``P;2147483640;0;3200``, where:

- ``P`` - Report Type: The "P" in the first field designates this as a "Pour Report"
- ``2147483640`` - RFID User: The "2147483640" indicates an RFID-identified user.  This field is not supported in Keg Cop and will always report "0"
- ``0`` - Pin Number: The "0" here is the tap number for the pour
- ``3200`` - Pulse Count: This is the number of pulses detected during the pour

Kick Report
============

Keg Cop will issue the Kick Report after the controller detects the tap blowing foam.  The report follows this format:

``K;2;0``

A semicolon (``;``) delimits the fields, and the fields are as follows:

- ``K`` - Report Type: The "K" in the first field designates this as a "Kick Report"
- ``2`` - Address: The "2" here is the tap number which has kicked
- ``0`` - Pin Number: The "0" here is the controller pin number for the pour

For RandR+-compatible systems, the Kick Report is slightly different.  For example:

``K;2147483640;6``

- ``K`` - Report Type: The "P" in the first field designates this as a "Pour Report"
- ``2147483640`` - RFID User: The "2147483640" identifies an RFID-identified user.  This is not supported in Keg Cop and will always report "0"
- ``6`` - Pin Number: The "6" here is the tap number for the pour

Keg Screen Reports
*******************

Keg Cop sends five different reports to the upstream Keg Screen system:

- `Send Tap Information Report`_
- `Send Pulse Report`_
- `Send Kick Report`_
- `Send Cooling State Report`_
- `Send Temperature Report`_

Send Tap Information Report
============================

Whenever a change is made to any of the tap information, this report is sent to the upstream system.  The configuration is as follows:

.. code-block:: json
    :linenos:

    {
        "api":"Keg Cop",
        "hostname":"kegcop",
        "breweryname":"Silver Fox Brewery",
        "kegeratorname":"Keezer",
        "reporttype":"tapinfo",
        "imperial":1,
        "tapid":3,
        "name":"Tanked 7",
        "ppu":21118,
        "remaining":2.2,
        "capacity":5,
        "active":true,
        "calibrating":false
    }

Send Pulse Report
===================

Whenever a pour completes, Keg Cop sends a pour report to teh Keg Screen system.  The format is as follows:

.. code-block:: json
    :linenos:

    {
        "api":"Keg Cop",
        "hostname":"kegcop",
        "breweryname":"Silver Fox Brewery",
        "kegeratorname":"Keezer",
        "reporttype":"pourreport",
        "tapid":0,
        "dispensed":0.004451,
        "remaining":4.195549
    }

Send Kick Report
==================

Keg Cop employs algorithm for detecting a kicked keg. When the pour volume exceeds a predetermined amount per second, Keg Cop considers that as evidence the keg is blowing foam and will mark the keg inactive. A kick report will be sent to the Keg Screen system. The format is as follows:

.. code-block:: json
    :linenos:

    {
        "api":"Keg Cop",
        "hostname":"kegcop",
        "breweryname":"Silver Fox Brewery",
        "kegeratorname":"Keezer",
        "reporttype":"kickreport",
        "tapid":0
    }

Send Cooling State Report
==========================

Whenever the cooling state changes, a state report is triggered for the Keg Screen system.  The format is as follows:

.. code-block:: json
    :linenos:

    {
        "api":"Keg Cop",
        "hostname":"kegcop",
        "breweryname":"Keg Cop Brewery",
        "kegeratorname":"Keezer",
        "reporttype":"coolstate",
        "state":3
    }

The thermostat state is one of the following:

- ``0``: ``TSTAT_INACTIVE`` - Thermostat is disabled
- ``1``: ``TSTAT_COOL_BEGIN`` - Thermostat is starting to cool
- ``2``: ``TSTAT_COOL_MINOFF`` - Thermostat is calling for cooling but in minimum off time
- ``3``: ``TSTAT_COOL_ACTIVE`` - Thermostat is actively cooling
- ``4``: ``TSTAT_OFF_END`` - Thermostat is not calling for cooling, minimum off time ending
- ``5``: ``TSTAT_OFF_MINON`` - Thermostat is not calling for cooling but in minimum on time
- ``6``: ``TSTAT_OFF_INACTIVE`` - Thermostat is not calling for cooling, in idle mode
- ``7``: ``TSTAT_UNKNOWN`` - Thermostat is in an unknown state

Send Temperature Report
=========================

A report containing all temperature points is sent to the Keg Screen system every minute. The format is as follows:

.. code-block:: json
    :linenos:

    {
        "api":"Keg Cop",
        "hostname":"kegcop",
        "breweryname":"Silver Fox Brewery",
        "kegeratorname":"Keezer",
        "reporttype":"tempreport",
        "imperial":true,
        "controlpoint":4,
        "setting":35,
        "status":3,
        "controlenabled":true,
        "sensors":[
            {
                "name":"Room",
                "value":85.1,
                "enabled":true
            },
            {
                "name":"Tower",
                "value":85.1,
                "enabled":true
            },
            {
                "name":"Upper Chamber",
                "value":78.8,
                "enabled":true
            },
            {
                "name":"Lower Chamber",
                "value":75.2,
                "enabled":true
            },
            {
                "name":"Keg",
                "value":84.2,
                "enabled":true
            }  
        ]
    }
