System Assembly
###################

As you have learned in the discussion for :ref:`planning your system <planning>`, Keg Cop is capable of a wide variety of configurations. Each has similar building blocks, and the description can be applied to a variety of applications.

Described here is a system with two flow meters, a room temp sensor, a keg temp sensor, a chamber sensor, cooling control, and a solenoid.

The main board is the centerpiece of the system. It hosts the controller and serves as a connection for the relay, sensors, and flow meters.

Power
*********

The system will be powered with a micro-USB cable plugged directly into the controller's USB port.

Flowmeters
************

In the diagram above, you can see a crucial feature of the system; a single Ethernet cable leads to one or more flowmeters. The first cable is from the main board (Tallboy, in this case) to the first flowmeter.  Using the Daisy Chain boards, the first connection is always Flowmeter #1.  Any subsequent connections will be #2, #2, and so on up to six.

Temperature Sensors
********************

Temperature sensors are optional; however, they will be used in this exemplar configuration.

Room Temperature
==================

The room temperature sensor is optional and is used for display/reference purposes only. If you choose to utilize a room-temperature sensor, you have a choice between soldering a DS18B20 in a TO-92 package directly to the PCB or using a sensor pre-assembled on a lead as is used in many other brewing projects.

If you use a TO-92 package sensor, be sure to provide ventilation for the main board. The ESP32 chip will generate some heat and throw off the readings if you do not.

Chamber Temperature
======================

Keg Cop offers four optional chamber sensors; two are used for this example.  A single Ethernet cable is used to connect the Sensor breakout board to the main board.  One pre-wired DS18B20 sensor is used each on the Keg and the Upper sensor ports.

Relays
************

This system will control both the cooling and solenoids. A two-channel 5VDC relay is used to provide this control.

Since the controller pins are 3V3 (3.3VCD), we use a separate 5VDC supply to the relay. This is optional but recommended.  Most relays seem to do fine when actuated with 3V3, but two extra wires are incredibly cheap for some peace of mind.

Remove the jumper between JD-VCC and VCC on the relay board.  Connect the two-pin header labeled POWER on the main board in the following manner:

- JD-VCC on the relay to V on POWER header
- GND on the relay to G on POWER header
- NOTE: The VCC pin on the relay's three-pin header remains unused

The four-pin header is used to control the relays. Connect the four-pin header labeled RELAY on the main board in the following manner:

- VCC on the relay to V on RELAY header
- IN2 on the relay to C on RELAY header
- IN1 on the relay to S on RELAY header
- GND on the relay to G on RELAY header

Cooling
========

In this diagram, Relay #2 is used for cooling. This document is not sufficient to describe how to do high voltage wiring. If you are not familiar with this concept, please seek out a licensed and insured electrician.

Generally, the relay is used to make or break the hot side of the high voltage electrical circuit. When used in this manner, run the hot leg to the COM2 terminal. Run the load side to the NO2 terminal.

Solenoid
=========

Solenoids come in a wide variety of configurations. This system is designed to provide a single relay to control one or more solenoids simultaneously. The solenoids should be powered with a separate, dedicated power supply of sufficient amperage and proper voltage for the relays being implemented.  Run them in parallel, through the COM1 and NO1 terminals on Relay #1.
